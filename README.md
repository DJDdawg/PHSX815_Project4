# PHSX815_Project4

The idea of Project 4 is to tie in the course concepts (parameter estimation or hypothesis testing) with an actual Physics experiment.

My experiment measures the charge of an electron based upon the amount of Shot Noise in an electronic system.

**Parameter Estimation**

The Poisson distribution is utilized to generate random data, 

$P(X | \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^{X} e^{- \lambda}}{X!}$.
